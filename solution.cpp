/*
 * Solution to http://projecteuler.net/problem=67
 *
 * Notes: This algorithm begins with the base of the triangle and 'rolls up' the rows
 * into the one above by comparing each row's elements to its immediate neighbor
 * choosing the one with the higher value and adding that to the shared adjacent
 * element in the next row. This continues until the 'top' of the triangle is reached.
 *
 * Assumptions: The input file is in perfect format containing only positive integers
 * and spaces in a 'triangle' format.
